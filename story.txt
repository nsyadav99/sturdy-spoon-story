It was a beatiful summer day and Nishant was relaxing on the beach. Suddenly he saw someone run past him away from the shore yelling "SHARK!".
Disturbed, he looked towards the shore to see an incredible sight. There was indeed a fin moving around in the water. As he watched, it
moved closer and closer to the shore until the point where it stood up and started walking on the beach! It was marching straight towards
him. He pulled down his shades to get a better look, and as the shark approached he could clearly see that it was actually a person in a shark
costume. He chuckled and as everyone else on the beach realized, the tension lessened. Later on, there was another call of "SHARK," but this
time the guy in the shark costume was over playing some beach volleyball.
