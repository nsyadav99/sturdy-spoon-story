It was a beatiful summer day and Nishant was relaxing on the beach. Suddenly he saw someone run past him away from the shore yelling "SHARK!".
Disturbed, he looked towards the shore to see an incredible sight. There was indeed a fin moving around in the water. As he watched, it
moved closer and closer to the shore until the point where it stood up and started walking on the beach! It was marching straight towards
him. He pulled down his shades to get a better look, and as the shark approached he could clearly see that it was actually a person in a shark
costume. He chuckled and as everyone else on the beach realized, the tension lessened. Later on, there was another call of "SHARK," but this
time the guy in the shark costume was over playing some beach volleyball. He then got in the water with the "shark."
	After being in the water for a short time, Nishant again heard some distant shouting, and once more were these shouts "shark." Nishant got out of the water at a leisurely pace, as he was disarmed from his previous experience. There was more noise in the distance, so naturally Nishant went to see what was going on this time. There were people pointing out into the water, and at first glance he saw a few people still out in the water, seemingly unaware of potential threat. As he looked out, he saw the fin. This time it was moving in a way unbecoming of a person. It started moving in the direction of some swimmers, and the people watching from the shore started to yell out to them. As the fin got close, water was spewn up into the air. The tensions eased a bit, as they all knew now that this couldn't be a shark; it was a dolphin.
